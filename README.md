# üß≠ Pathfinding Visualizer - React Project

This project is an interactive Path-finding Visualizer built with React, designed as a learning tool, the visualizer helps users understand how different algorithms explore a grid, find the shortest path, and handle obstacles ‚Äî all with a clean UI and responsive performance.

## üìÅ Project Overview

üõ† Built using **React** and bootstrapped with **Create React App**.

üéØ Focuses on **pathfinding algorithms** and their visual representation.

üß© All tutorial-related source code is located in:
- `src/PathfindingVisualizer`
- `src/algorithms`

The main visualizer component is imported and rendered in `App.js`.
